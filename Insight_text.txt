Resume Shortlist 2. Interview

NMTronics India Private Limited Insights on the interview process
In my opinion, this was the most unexpected and credible interview I gave during my placement process. All previous companies would ask some boring questions related to the topic like what this is, what is that without any relevance. However, in this interview, the interviewer, Mr. Sumanyu asked me which project I liked from my resume. And he just started asking questions that led to the very basics which was, tbh, the very correct way to do an interview.

NMTronics India Private Limited Sample Interview Questions?
What is your fav project in your resume? 2. What would happen if the bot was designed for the Moon rather than on Earth (related to my project)? 3. Explaining the kinematics of the bot I worked on. 4. A little bit into control stuff, but the very basics, nothing advanced.

NMTronics India Private Limited Preparation Resources
I wasn’t really expecting any robotics company this placement year. I got lucky that we had an opening on day 6 or 7, I guess. So, I didn’t prepare anything for the robotics profile. In general, have basics covered 1. Kinematics (understanding Degrees of freedom, workspace, joint and task space) 2. Path planning (in robotics) 3. Coding in C++ ( a few robotics companies that interviewed my friends asked questions)

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Robotics, unlike coding profiles, has very to the basic placement process. The questions asked don’t require you to be very expert in the field but expect you to know the basics. So, have your basics revised, know how stuffs work and you are good to go.

Heading:Aditya Pratap Singh: Placed at NVIDIA
NVIDIA Aditya Pratap Singh from BT/EE dept. Roll no - 200053 Upcoming Formal Verification Engineer @ NVIDIA, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining NVIDIA Role - Formal Verification Engineer (ASIC Engineer). Here are some brief insights.

NVIDIA Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Microsoft (Software) Infurnia (Software) Navi (Software) NVIDIA (Core)

NVIDIA Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Resume Shortlisting 2. Technical Test - Objective having mostly analytical math problems and few questions on OS, basic programming and other computer fundamentals. The test was NOT difficult. Fundamental understanding of these topics is required. 3. Technical Interviews (3 rounds)

NVIDIA Insights on the interview process
1st roundQuestions on math puzzles, basic coding stuff, resume projects. I had a project related to Verilog; they were mostly interested in that. You should know your resume projects very well for this round. 2nd roundDiscussed about the job role. The interviewer wanted to know whether I am actually interested in the profile. Questions related to my resume. 3rd roundPretty much the same as the 2nd round. Discussed about the profile, job location. You are free to ask any questions from the interviewer.

NVIDIA Sample Interview Questions?
Difficulties you faced in making your resume projects. 2. If it was a team project, how did you manage all the different tasks with other members. 3. Did you face any difficulty/disagreement working with the team; and if yes how did you resolve the situation.

NVIDIA Preparation Resources
1)For coding/software profile I highly recommend solving the CSES problem set (covers many standard questions of varying difficulty). Once you are comfortable with the standard questions, start doing some difficult problems immediately. (Codeforces problem set, particularly problems having rating around 1800). 2)For NVIDIA core profile Courses on Computer Systems such as Computer Organization and Computer Architecture. Even though a very good understanding of CS220 is enough, having an inclination towards computer architecture will definitely be advantageous in the interview process. Some basic OS, OOPS, DBMS concepts (either through IITK courses or any youtube playlists)

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Dos 1. Make sure you know your resume very well. Having a project where you actually spent good time and effort would really help in the interviews. 2. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. You won’t need any outside help to clear the technical tests. Don’ts 1. Don’t just solve easy coding problems. It won’t help unless you make yourself comfortable with hard problems.

Heading:Aditya Tanwar: Placed at Glean
Glean Name Aditya Tanwar Roll Number 200057 Programme BT Department CSE, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Glean (SE). Here are some brief insights.

Glean Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Da Vinci (C++ SE) - Databricks (SE) - Sprinklr ("Product Engineer"/SE) - Google (SE) - Capital One (SE) - Cohesity (SE) - Quantbox (Systems, Quant) - Worldquant (QR) - Quadeye (Systems, Quant) - Infurnia (SE) - Navi (SE) - Stripe (SE) - Plutus (SE)

Glean Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1)For Glean, the process is similar to the one they follow for internships. The initial shortlisting is based on resume (huge emphasis on branch and CPI, cutoff ~9.3 iirc). 2)The shortlisted candidates are directly interviewed on the first day of placements with 2-3 technical rounds, followed by a final behavioral/HR round.

Glean Insights on the interview process
1)Each technical round has a simple question in the beginning, you are expected to explain your approach while also writing code for the same. 2)Each time you solve a question during a round, new constraints/subparts are introduced - progressively increasing the difficulty. 3)Sometimes you might get stuck, your approach might be incorrect, you might not understand the question completely, or something similar - in any of these cases, feel free to discuss the difficulty you are facing with your interviewer, they will help you out as much as they can. Do NOT shy away from taking help, it might otherwise harm your candidacy. 4)The last round is more or less an HR round. Your reasons for joining Glean should be clear; try to phrase them before the interview if you're not confident. There might also be a technical question or two in this round.

Glean Sample Interview Questions?
A very crude example for Glean Start with a BFS-like solution, then Dijkstra, and finally conclude with Bellman-Ford. Ofcourse, the actual solutions you will be expected to implement will not be so standard, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how the question difficulty progresses in a technical round. Each round was ~1 hr. 2) For Da Vinci For the initial shortlisting, there was a subjective exam which included 2-3 coding questions and some other theoretical questions (from CSE topics). The questions were not too difficult to solve in themselves. A lot of emphasis was given on the style of code (code was likely checked manually), and good practices. Post this subjective test, there were group discussions [on zoom], where they asked open-ended questions and anyone willing to answer was given the floor. Candidates were likely judged based on originality as well as relevance to the expected solution. For the software GD, being familiar with good coding practices (in actual industry-level C++ code) is desirable. 3) On the final day, you will likely be asked to implement some functionality that is used daily in the company. It will be reduced to a toy functionality so that you can actually implement it in a single round. You will be given a brief explanation about the functionality and the features expected, feel free to ask for clarifications. There was a single round of ~40 mins on the final day.

Glean Preparation Resources
I had exhausted InterviewBit during the intern season and did not feel the need to do it again. So, I directly moved to giving CF contests and practicing the problemset on CSES. The questions there are relevant and to-the-point, and when you solve a question, there are nice green colours to keep you motivated. 2) For DBMS and Networks, I stuck to the course slides provided at IITK, they are sufficient in my opinion. I did not revise topics like OS, Compilers, Computer Architecture/Organization since I was not aiming for a systems role at an HFT but I strongly advise you to revise them if you are considering systems@HFT, especially OS and Architecture. 3) I did however revise C++ paradigms by reading the articles on learncpp.com, the articles there are nicely organized (both on a micro scale as well as a macro scale), and they also provide MWE's to get the point across. Having a strong hold on C++, both theoretically and practically, is also recommended for systems@HFT.

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Do - Start practicing right as your intern ends. In any case, do not be any late than the beginning of the semester. - Upsolve the questions you're not able to solve in a test, they are often repeated. On the same vein, discuss solutions with your peers. - Ask for help from friends with scheduling your interviews/submitting your resumes in December. - Read about the company (their history, their clients, what they do, their product, etc.) you're interviewing for and articulate why you want to join them. A lot of companies gauge how interested a candidate is in them. Do not - Stop practicing when the tests start. Both can be done together, and is recommended. - Be afraid to "mess" around the testing environment and find out. More often than not, there are loopholes (within the grounds of morality) that you can use to your advantage. For example, you might be able to print test cases in some environments if you're clever enough. There are better examples that I do not want to include here. - Lose hope ) - There are bound to be some upsetting shortlists, some disappointing environments. Push through it, it will be worth it.

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Be strong with the basics Now that I am a working professional now, I know exactly what companies look for in a fresher. Believe me, the only thing you gonna be evaluated on is how much dedicated you were to learn in your college days. Based on the department you belong to, any interviewer would ask you basics from subjects you had in your graduation to assess whether you were genuinely interested in the knowledge your field of study provided you or not. Be confident Interviewers completely understand the anxious state of your mind as you would be appearing for first interviews of your life. Most of the interviewers are mature enough to let you settle down by simply talking about anything you like before they get into the real stuff. But, some interviewers do expect you to be confident on your own. One strategy I used to follow was acting to be confident. When you act like you are confident, it eventually makes you confident in real. Be honest while making your resume Many freshers commit mistake of adding all the fancy points in their resume to impress the interviewer. Believe me, this might backfire on you. An interviewer uses that piece of paper to find out in what domain he can ask you questions. If you add any bluff, there are high chances you would be caught and therefore reducing your chances to get placed. So, make sure you add only what you are confident about in your resume. Think before you answer It wouldn't matter if you take sometime to think before you answer. But if you blabber unclear answer without thinking how to put it forward and explain it clearly, it's surely gonna create a wrong impression even if you knew the answer. Frame the sentence well in your mind and then deliver your answer in a crisp way. Taking those extra 5 seconds to frame a sentence will help you a lot. Prepare well for apti Most of the companies ask for apti in the first round. Make sure you regularly find time to practice those, in order to have an edge over other candidates for clearing the apti. Don't take 'areas of interest' in your resume lightly Many candidates lose their chance because of this. Make sure you add the topics you are most strong in and are genuinely interested in, under the areas of interest. It doesn't always have to be some trending technologies or research topic. Anything that you think you can have a higher level discussion with interviewer on can be added as your areas of interest. An interviewer expects you to have fairly good knowledge about the topics you add in your areas of interest, as those are the topics the interviewer assumes you are genuinely interested in and would have done some decent research on. For example, in my case, I loved competitive coding. So I added simple topics like competitive coding, data structures and design and analysis of algorithm as my areas of interest and never had a problem discussing those topics with interviewers. Don't lose hope even if you get rejected multiple times Last but not the least, no matter what, don't stop yourself from preparing for interviews even after you get rejected multiple times. You can whine or cry over it, but don't stop trying. Keep asking yourself what went wrong the last time and improve yourself on that. Just never give up. I hope these points will be helpful.

Sprinklr Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
1.Open to all 2.No resume shortlist 3.No GD 4.Test - It consists of 3 coding questions with mostly medium level difficulty (~CF 1300-1600). A person who almost solves all the questions gets shortlisted for the interview

Sprinklr Insights on the interview process
The interview was a nice experience. It consisted of four rounds, each round being an elimination. First 3 rounds were techical comprising mostly of programming questions and a few small puzzles along with questions from OS and resume. First two rounds were a bit relaxed with questions asked by seniors who probably had 2-3 years in experience. The third round was taken by vice president which was a bit longer and detailed. Last round is a hr round which is mostly to judge interest and skills. Always have a pre-info of the work done by the company

Sprinklr Sample Interview Questions?

Sprinklr Preparation Resources
1.Software Development - If you are starting early, then keep solving codeforces contests (live or virtual), try to push your rating to expert, but being specialist is okay. Use PClub’s test archives, they are very handy as they contain almost similar questions as in an actual test. You can solve leetcode/interviewBit in parallel but be aware of the time left for preparation. 2.OS - CS330 notes, Networks - CS425 notes (Not strictly mandatory) Quants and Banks - Xinfeng Zhou’s book and puzzledquant website, some questions will be present in both. The important thing is a solid base is probability and statistics (MSO201 is a good resource)

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
It is okay if you don't have a relevant intern or no intern at all. Just start early and be consistent. Please keep your 7th/9th sem a bit relaxed, don't infuse unnecessary courses. Also if you want to switch from the current field, this is the chance. Companies will hire you on the basis of your skills (mostly, but yes, sometimes cpi and department advantage is present). Another thing, never lie that you know certain stuff you've mentioned in the resume and then act like you can't recall. Just say I don't have any experience with that thing. Since I have spent 5 years here, on a reality check side, yes, cpi matters, but can be balanced with skills and achievements. Never think of yourself being underconfident, people often pull off incredible stuff on the D-day. Be calm and composed, and you've got this! All the best!

United Airlines Insights on the interview process
2 rounds (both technical) 1st round 30 min 2nd round 1 hr.

United Airlines Sample Interview Questions?
1st Round(30 mins) focused on basic python programming skills and SQL query logic building skills, some SQL theoretical questions,followed by a few ML questions and it lasted for 30 minutes. Python program was as basic as coding fibonacci series upto nth term. A medium SQL query question, where they mainly focused on the logic building ability, as I didn’t remember the syntax but could partially solve it with the hints that they were dropping, I was considered. Some theoretical SQL questions like GROUP BY vs HAVING clause, Aggregate functions in SQL and so on. ML questions were based on Decision tree, bagging vs boosting(Very imp. Concepts from interview point of view). 2nd Round(60 mins) was divided into 2 segments 1st was an ML breadth and depth segment(30 mins), 2nd was a case study segment(30 mins). In the 1st segment the interviewer asked all sorts of ML questions like Ensemble learning(again v. important), generative modeling vs discriminative modeling, evaluation metrics like precision and recall and what would be used in a spam filter,regularization techniques etc. and DL questions on gradient descent, backprop, objective functions that are used in LLM(This was asked as I had been working on LLM for my thesis, plus it is the hot topic of today’s time), role of filters and pooling layers in CNN and so on. The 2nd segment was a case study on Zomato food delivery. This was more of a discussion session, where they didn’t want the exact solution but wanted to figure out what was my thinking process to approach the solution. The initial discussion revolved around data pre-processing/engineering, like what features to be kept and discarded. And after about 20 mins they emphasized on the model building approach.

United Airlines Preparation Resources
DSA from Striver sheet 2) Aptitude from Prepinsta, gfg 3) SQL from Leetcode 4) ML and Data Science (CS771, CampusX, blogs in towards data science, analytics vidhya, machine learning mastery are notable few, some design/case study questions can also be prepared)

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Prepare ML and DL basics really well, as for fresher hire they drill you on the basics. 2. SQL is a must if you’re aiming for DS roles ( I regret not preparing for it enough!!). 3. Think of bridging theory and practice, again this will help in case study rounds. 4. Some good projects demonstrating your knowhow and expertise always helps. 5. Do keep a backup plan in your head(even if it’s hypothetical), which will relieve a lot of stress during interviews. (A small mental hack)) 1. Don’t solely prepare for Data Science roles even if you’re eyeing for one, rather keep the preparation general(by that I mean prepare for 2 other roles, which will give you an opportunity to face more interviews), and you can always switch/hunt for your preferred role later, while having an offer in your hand. 2. Don’t let disappointments and despair get the better of you. Even if you see your mates getting placed while you’re struggling, try holding onto the idea that “you’ll sail through somehow”. YOUR TURN WILL COME, AND SOME OF THOSE MATES WILL BE YOUR GREATEST CHEERLEADERS!!

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Interview Students often forget that interviews are 2 ways ie; you must judge and gauge the company atmosphere just as the companies judges you. Instead of going from the objective to prove yourself, try to go into the interview from an objective of having a meaningful discussion with seniors in your industry, learning from their experiences and highlighting your capabilities. 2) Narrative Throughout your preparation, try to follow a meaningful narrative. I tried my best to work in not only the role but also the field of my interest. This helped me chart a coherent narrative regarding my journey, why and how I developed my skills, my PORs and the companies I worked for. This is a highly role and company dependent advice, do consult seniors in your dream companies regarding what the company values and looks for. 3) Confidence Most people can answer most questions, and there are high chances they can do it better than you. Your confidence and passion is your greatest asset. Even when you lose a job/internship opportunity, don’t get disheartened and try to learn from your mistakes(or forgive the company’s mistakes p) Placements are stressful and mentally taxing, but if you approach this process with integrity and honesty, your experience will not only be fulfilling but also much easier.

world quant Preparation Resources
• 50 Challenging Problems in Probability • BrainStellar • A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews – by Xinfeng Zhou • Website – PuzzledQuant

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Don’t panic even if the environment around you is negative because there’s high chance that you talk to someone and hear something negative. Don’t lose you motivation to practice, just be disciplined for a month or two. I know things can get difficult but try to be consistent. Don’t be like you study 10 hours one day and then you’re exhausted for 3 days, rather study 5-6 hours a day for 4 days. After you’re done with your practice it is important that you try to explain your work, just like in an interview, be it your code or even your past projects, that too in English because fluent communication is also quite important. For your HR round, prepare for standard HR questions in advance and be confident in whatever you say. For Resume, keep it clean, avoid typing errors and grammatical mistakes as it creates a bad impression, also instead of spamming projects in your resume its better to mention those projects which are relevant for your profile and you’re confident in.

Pine Labs Insights on the interview process
1.1st Round was resume-based plus a Product Knowledge-based round. Not given any specific product case but the interviewer analyzed product thinking ability by asking questions related to Resume projects, like “What was the user flow for this app you developed?” Explain the metrics in each step and what was the north star metric.” 2.2nd Round was Resume Grilling- 3.3rd Round was purely HR & behavioral questions.

Pine Labs Preparation Resources
1.)Doremon Den Bootcamp 2.)PM School Case Practice Videos 3.)Books like Cracking the PM Interview, Swipe to Unlock, Decode and Conquer 4.)Victor Cheng Case Videos & IITB Case Book for Consulting Cases 5.)GFG & Brainstellar Puzzles

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
1.)One thing that helped me this placement season was being determined about my role i.e. Product. In summer 2023, I enrolled myself in a Product Bootcamp- Doremon Den which helped me familiarize with PM concepts. I did a PMIG Project here at IIT Kanpur- which helped me make decks. Plus I participated in a Product Folks hackathon. 2.)While Preparing for PM, consulting or any managerial role- you need to focus on case preparation. Instead of just reading cases from any book, try solving it with your friends. I took help from Seniors & Doremon Den mentors to help me solve mock cases. Also solve cases in a flow chart manner (try to write it for future reference). Later, read/discuss the solution and write the things that you missed to make your solution better. STRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CASES!! 3.)Resume Shortlisting is a major step in getting a PM role. Luckily I had a Product Growth Intern but apart from that I made sure I had at least 1 Product project in my Resume. Use terms like Metrics, User flow, and other product-related terms to highlight. And having POR’s is a plus.

Flipkart Preparation Resources

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
Study well…I guess. You are in an IIT, you know the drill. Study with a curiosity and study with an openness; try to make it a process that is less mechanical and more fun. Solve cases, solve guesstimates, solve puzzles as much as possible. Go through your projects thoroughly and stand in front of a mirror acting like your own interviewer. Take a second to distance yourself from your own head and act like you have no idea about who you are and will judge yourself purely from this resume in your hand. Ask every possible question you can about your resume and find where you make errors. Revise and remake your project details and keep going till you are sure you won’t stutter. Do this as soon as possible, hopefully before your endsems. You this alone first and then with friends and experienced seniors. Remember to switch between being your greatest critic to your own best friend during placement preparation. Identify your shortcomings when you speak up and hype up yourself when you are doing well. Also, a word of advice- the world doesn’t end if you don’t get placed. There will be a world out there ready to embrace you and you will fit in somewhere when the time comes. Having known this, give every interview and test your very best.

Heading:Jasjot Singh: Placed at N.A.
N.A. Jasjot Singh BT CSE 200468, studying in IIT Kanpur will be joining Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief insights.

N.A. Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Companies NK Securities, Sprinklr, Cohesity, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs

N.A. Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
The selection process for most companies includes an online coding test followed by interviews on day one. Some companies like HFTs place a CPI shortlist as well for sitting in the test (this is around 8 or 8.5 in most cases). Online assessments start after midsems in September so I tried to solve as many coding problems during that period as possible. If you have multiple interviews on day one, you have to be smart about your scheduling of interviews. Have a preference order in your mind and give interviews according to that, since you might not be able to give an interview in all your shortlisted companies due to clashes.

N.A. Insights on the interview process
N.A.

N.A. Sample Interview Questions?
NK Securities Egg Dropping Problem, start with 2 eggs, then 3 eggs version. Later on, asked a version based on infinite floors. Then a hard coding problem based on graphs. Goldman Sachs Firstly, I was asked questions based on my resume, specifically the work I had done in my intern and a finance project. Most banks and quants will grill you on any finance project that you mention in your resume so prepare well for it. In the second round, I was asked an optimisation problem and then some questions based on probability and statistics. The questions were medium-hard and I was able to do them all. Cohesity I was asked to screen share and do a live coding problem based on smartly using some data structures (sort of a system design problem where I had to process some data efficiently based on given constraints), the problem was doable.

N.A. Preparation Resources
For coding, I focused on solving Leetcode problems as much as possible. Another important resource was Programming club archives. They have some really good questions that were asked in coding tests of companies previously so make sure you do all of those problems. They have contests of 1.5 hours with 3 problems in each, so attempt within the time given to handle time well during the actual assessments. One can also do competitive programming from CodeForces during preparation for developing their problem-solving skills and handling time pressure. For quant, solve all problems from the book Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability and then move on to problems from Xinfeng Zhou. The first book has very few problems but you have to understand the basics of all the problems really well because you will not be asked those questions straightforward in most scenarios. They will ask you the standard version and then build up to an advanced and tougher problem which can only be solved if you know logic really well.

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
If you are targeting certain companies, go to their Glassdoor page or ask seniors and get some information about what questions they have previously asked in OAs. It’s very likely that they will repeat some topics. Always prepare for placements in a small group and help each other as much as possible. It can get really stressful around midsem break in October so try to stay calm and get some rest during that time. Don’t get disheartened if your name is not there in the shortlist of couple of companies, there are lots of companies coming for placements and you need an offer from one of them )

CPI matters a lot atleast for shortlisting for tests.

This shows your sincerity towards the role. 3) DO practice HR questions as well. They may seem insignificant but there is a certain way to answer them, which can really turn the course of your interview. 4) Include key words in the resume related to different expected roles. Get it verified by as many seniors as possible. 5) Interviewers don’t expect you to know everything, but are more focused on whether you can justify what you have done over the years. So ensure you are thorough with the things mentioned in resume 6) Technical questions can be asked in any format, so be prepared for solving on spot questions 7) Finally, be confident, they may try to confuse you or grill you, but you have to be confident to get by. Best of luck!!

Sprinklr Selection Process of the Company you are selected in 1) Resume Shortlist, 2) GD, 3)Test
Aptitude test on Hackerearth, followed by 3 rounds of case interviews and 1 HR round.

Sprinklr Insights on the interview process
The first three rounds were product case rounds, which included guesstimates and varied problems on product design, feature ideation/improvement and metrics. In guesstimates, the interviewer was not looking for hard figures or calculations, but rather a structured approach and attention to detail (say, for example, figuring an edge case out – an example would be to solve for a metric dip in Spotify and not forgetting to count in podcasts!) In product design problems, coming up with innovative insights to the problem based on personal experience, or recommending novel solutions seemed to leave a good impression on the interviewer. It goes on to show that the candidate has a strong sense of products, in general. Overall, I consider a basic knowledge of technology and digital products and how they work, a necessary element to navigating this interview.

Sprinklr Sample Interview Questions?
Product Design - 1. In India, there are challenges related to legal awareness and accessibility. Individuals often lack information about their legal rights and processes, such as renting an apartment or filing taxes. Furthermore, the accessibility of legal proceedings is hindered by the difficulty of finding qualified lawyers and booking public interest litigations (PILs). Design a digital product designed to address these issues by improving access to legal information, facilitating the search for lawyers, and streamlining the process for booking PILs. (35 mins) 2. You are a PM at Hero MotoCorp. Design a new motorcycle for the average Indian, akin to a ‘Splendor’, considering their needs of today. (10 mins) 1. You are a PM at WhatsApp. There are plans to make WhatsApp a super-app of sorts. How will you approach ideating the features you may want to introduce? (5 mins) 1. You are a PM at Airbnb. Your CEO has ordered you to prepare a dashboard of 5 absolutely crucial metrics that they need to see every morning, to gauge how the company is doing. Devise these 5 metrics and supply reasoning. (5 mins) The usual Why Sprinklr? Why you? Why product? Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Sprinklr Preparation Resources
https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGaFxw9XFTw&list=PLqtwvdE26B_RqemTzPe1NwfufeNV5USEI PM School Explainers a great playlist on nailing absolute essentials for a fresher PM interview (PM interview skills != PM skills!) Following startup, unicorn, tech news on LinkedIn/X and reading on them further Going through a case deck or two every day on LinkedIn/PM School everyday (in peak placement prep season) in case you wish to sit for other product companies as well )

Advice for students (do's and don'ts)
For PM Roles- 1. PM prep, like design, involves building a product sense and it involves a lot of "unorganised” knowledge acquisition in the form of random internet browsing, reading, looking at real life examples and making inferences. So, follow product managers and unicorn founders on LinkedIn and X, and keep reading on what they have to say; look at upcoming YC companies/Indian unicorns and read on their business models, product design, etc. You get the point! 2. Don’t be afraid to take time to think in an interview. Always think out aloud, draw-and-show, and let the interviewer know your assumptions, raw thoughts, hypotheses etc., however learn to think independently as well, so as to avoid getting biased by thoughts like these. The key is to always maintain a certain logical structure to solving a problem. For placements - 1. I CANNOT emphasize enough the importance of confidence! As my friend (Advait) Vashi said, GIVE your interview with the assumption ki “tera nahi hi hone wala”. No amount of interview rejections define your ability. There is literally nothing to lose, and life has great things for you!

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Don’t quit. There will be times when you might feel that all this is useless, and I’ll be happy with an internship that pays less, but don’t let those thoughts take over. Consistency is everything, and even if you feel demotivated, you must not give up. Prepare in groups. This is indeed a double-edged sword. It might favour you or not, but it totally depends on you. But I feel that if you know what your peers are doing, you tend to feel motivated towards your goal. Talk to seniors. We are always there to help and guide you. So whenever you feel demotivated, just call any of your seniors, and they will give you the right advice. Believe me, we have already gone through what you are going through, so we can understand your situation much better.

Make the full use of your summers. Writing down a weekly/daily schedule helped in my case. It ensures you actually get stuff done, plus boosts your confidence in your own prep. Prepare a good introduction for yourself, and get help from your seniors for this who have given such interviews. A good intro can set the interviewer in a good mindset, plus it helps you set the narrative for your interview. (Tip -> mention the topics you are confident about briefly in your intro) Stay connected with your friends, can’t stress how important this is. Will help you stay updated, and most importantly stay motivated. Give your best but try not to stress about it too much. Sometimes the decision of a company might seem irrational, but it is important not to take it personally and move forward.

In interviews emphasis was given on puzzles and probability questions with a few questions on the resume. The students should be well versed with their projects and it is better if project topics are diverse.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Set your goals and keep working...Luck is a manifestation of your hard work and it will be there when you need it..you have to give your best! Do DSA well, and do Puzzles and Probability problems in parallel so you are not bored doing one thing only. Prepare yourself comprehensively for the interviews and finally presentation is very important. Explain your thought process clearly and in a step by step manner trying that the interview flows smoothly like a conversation and not a QnA session. During preparation don’t get stuck on one question for too long, because time is limited and it might lead to frustration. Don’t leave a question for the next day, instead look at the solution if you can't get it and revise it after a few days. Also while doing DSA(InterviewBit) after learning a bit of arrays(searching and sorting) and linked lists, start with trees, graphs, dp and spend a lot of time on them because these topics are difficult and time consuming.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
I was more oriented towards getting a core job. Solely I was not preparing for this role. Those who are going for core, resources are very easily available nothing usually comes out of your course content. What you have to do is grasp your core concepts properly. Analog and Digital from ESC201. Sampling questions, practical laboratory-based questions, ESO203, these were most important things. For core prep last 15-20 days are more than enough. I was not majorly oriented towards prep of a Data scientist so I can’t really suggest resources for that, but I feel the machine learning concepts you learn while doing your course or any project are enough. For SDE prep I used youTube, Codechef and I was not a very good coder I started and did coding in 3-month time only. Again, because my goal eventually was not SDE. Start as early as possible. Decide your domain in which you want to go. Practice and learn accordingly. Do DSA. Have good knowledge about everything you’re mentioning in your resume, especially projects.

Round 1 We played a series of games, testing various skills. 80 in 8 is probably the most popular one, based on mental math. Other games tested things like reaction times, memory, logical reasoning etc. If you wanted to apply for the SDE role you also had to answer a separate test for it. Round 2 We were informed that it would be a GD round but it was changed into an online interview. Questions were based on guesstimates and probability primarily. We also played a market making game based on a doc that was shared right before this round. Round 3 (Day 1) There were 3 rounds of interviews, 2 technical and 1 HR, the order varied between candidates. The technical round still focused on probability questions and the market making game. Rough paper was not allowed for any of the rounds, all calculations had to be done in your head.

Consistent preparation throughout the summer is single-handedly the most important thing you can do to increase your chances of getting selected. Stick to one set of resources, and do them religiously till you feel like you can recall questions as soon as you see them. It is probably one of the most stressful times that you will ever face on campus, so try to keep your mental health in check while you prepare. It is extremely easy to spiral into negative thoughts if you have a bad day, or when you don’t get shortlists even after giving your best efforts, but remember that you only need that one success, so try to ignore all the external factors and do whatever you can to help your case.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Do’s Start preparing early, because at the end of summer, tests will literally leave no time for skill building. Start at the beginning of summer if you want to learn any new skill/ improve coding. Focus on OOP concepts, they are asked a lot in quant firms (Optiver and alphagrep had a round specifically for OOP). Try to work on good self-projects which you can showcase in your resume as well. Don'ts Don’t start everything in the suggested resources at once, and it is fine if you don’t cover all the resources, first focus on understanding the higher level concepts and then practice more questions. If you attempt a coding problem, write actual code and not just the idea, translating your ideas into code is a very important skill in tests and interviews. Don’t just solve the complete question in the mind (applicable to both puzzles as well as coding problems), try to interactively solve them with friends, it improves your ability to express your ideas better.

Start your preparation early. Don’t get dejected when you rare not able to solve questions specially coding problems. In the interview be active and try to converse with your interviewer, if there was something that I was not able to solve then I would ask the interviewer for hints. One thing more is that to have a short story around the points in your resume, because the interviewer will grill you on your resume. There should be a flow in your resume, like how did you get there, even in projects, why did you do that project. So, you should have some reason for that and things should feel natural. Start reading books, it will increase your reading speed & understand better and will help in solving analytics questions because they will give you 20 questions for about 30-45mins. Have a study partner with you to prepare so you do not lose your motivation.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Do not postpone or delay your preparation for internships in the summer. You can excel even if you have not started the preparation before summer and get ahead of your batchmates. Just set a target and do everything to achieve the same. If you get placed in the first month of the internships which is by Sept Mid you will get a lot of time to focus and enjoy on other things. Select a primary profile to target in the internships but do not leave the other profiles, keep looking for opportunities even if you do not get placed during the Phase 1 of internships. Just work on your skills and you will definitely get an internship either from SPO or through some off campus if you have the desired skills(even though you do not have the cpi).

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Do(s) - Practice on InterviewBit irrespective of the role you are targeting. For Quant, you can also focus on Brainstellar along with InterviewBit. - For GD, talk to seniors and instead of speaking mugged up answers in the GD, try to explore and be present. Mugged up answers might leave a negative impression onnthe recruiter. - Many people do not practice enough DSA questions or do not have a strong sommand on DSA. Practice as much as you can and focus on hard problems. Give enough time for the hard problems, it might take more than one sitting but do not directly jump to see the solution. - Do GeeksforGeeks’ prop questions. - Focus not only on DSA, but on OOPs and SQL as well Don't(s); - Do not waste your summers. Even if you have not started anything, do it in the summers. Utilize your summers to the fullest. - Do not get disheartened because of your CPI. It is indeed and important factor but not the only factor. If you work hard and give your best, CPI mighy not matter much. - For people targeting the Consulting profiles, do not just prepare for Consulting. Prepare for other profiles as well.

Atharv vibhas jiwane: Summer Intern at Oracle Insights on the Selection Process
ITC  Application form -> Test(?) -> Shortlist -> Group Discussion -> Shortlist -> 2 rounds of Interviews. • Lengthy form, I vaguely remember giving some sort of skill- assessment test which was gamified. • Group Discussion was based on the same question that was given by ITC last year. • 1st round of Interview was based on some questions related to projects and not-very-deep theoretical questions related to core mechanical course like thermodynamics, dynamics and fluids. • Interview panel consisted of a technical interviewer (IITK alum) and an HR interviewer. • Some family background and candidate background questions. • I would say that they were looking for someone with more project/work experience in the core field. • For core questions, revise basic concepts in thermodynamics like plots, engines, pumps, refrigerator, etc and dynamics and fluids like boundary layer, evaporation, etc. • Very few questions related to team management/ leadership questions related to the PORs that I had mentioned. • Did not make it to the second round of interviews. Oracle  Application Form -> Coding Test -> Shortlist -> 4 rounds of Interviews • Nominal form • The coding round was held offline in a lecture hall and was not proctored on the platform. There were 3 questions of increasing difficulty. The first two questions were of medium difficulty and the last one was hard. • Interview shortlist comes for two positions - Server Tech and Application Developer. • First Round - Introduction -> 1-2 generic medium-difficulty coding questions to solve on paper and explain -> I was lucky to be asked some questions about my department related to 3D printing and manufacturing based on the interviewers interest -> I was asked about my PORs • Second Round - Was asked to pick my preferred data structure and asked to generate a coding question and solve it on the spot. • Third Round - Generic questions related to high-school probability and statistics like histograms, medians and what is the chance that…?, etc. Mainly, a SQL task related to performing one of the joins was given (inner join as far as I remember). • Fourth Round - HR round. Were you born and brought up in India? Do you want to go for higher studies? Are you an Indian citizen?

Atharv vibhas jiwane: Summer Intern at Oracle Preparation Resources

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
• Revise your projects well, learn to describe your project experience using the S.T.A.R. (Story/Background. Task/Goal. Approach. Result/Outcome) approach. A good background story always helps! • Review the tech stack that the company prefers. Ask seniors if the company asks questions about specific things for eg. Oracle questioned candidates about SQL apart from DSA. • Review requirements listed by the company, ask seniors for the type of questions that the company asks etc. • Don’t underestimate the importance of InterviewBit in your preparation. • Prepare your resume thoroughly. You should be able to describe and defend every line of your resume. • Don’t skip to the solution if you are stuck on a problem on LeetCode/ InterviewBit. Instead, persist for a while and try to figure the logic on your own. This has a propelling impact on your preparation.

There were 3 rounds in total 1. Test Test was online and had 3 sections · Technical Questions Related mostly to Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer in general · Aptitude Questions Typical aptitude problems like identifying the pattern, sequences and puzzles were asked. · HR Questions This question had HR questions like why DRL, why core type questions. 2. Group Discussion A topic related to chemical engineering and a few questions related to it were given. First everyone was asked to speak for 2 minutes turn by turn on a given question of their choosing and later everyone was asked to join in like a typical GD. 3. Interview There were 2 rounds · Technical Round Mostly they ask questions related to some core stuff about reactors, heat transfer or mass transfer. Sometimes they ask you your favourite course and questions from it. · HR Round This was a long round, the interviewer would ask you to go through your resume once and typical HR questions like why DRL, why Core etc. were asked here as well.

Avi Gupta: Summer Intern at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories – Core Engineering Preparation Resources
Core Stuff Going through notes of the courses taught in 2 nd year will be suffice. Just make sure that your concepts are clear in these courses. Mental Ability Solving previous year CAT questions can help. In my case going through puzzles section of Interviewbit and solving Brainstellar helped a lot. GD Joining sessions organized by AnC and SPO for GD practice would help a lot. You can also practice GDs with your friends in general, just make sure you have a senior who joins to guide and explain you how to proceed in a GD.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Dos · Try to narrow down the profiles you are targeting as early as possible, narrowing down preparation to 2-3 profiles is better. · Having a diverse profile helps a lot in case of core jobs. · Try to have atleast one project related to domain you are targeting. Don’ts · Try not to rely completely on profiles like Techno-managerial and Consulting as shortlisting in these profiles are highly uncertain. Always have a backup in case you are targeting these profiles. · Don’t write anything on your resume that you are unsure of, make sure that you are thorough with your resume.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
The most important lesson that I learnt during the internship season was to never let a rejection get into your head and never give up. You are more important than any company or profile, so even if you get rejected by a company in which you had high hopes of getting selected, always remember that it is never your loss provided you gave your best. You will eventually get what you deserve and that will be much better than you could imagine. So never give up and always remember you will never be defined with your intern company or profile, but by who you are as a person even without it ;) Confidence is key. Even if you know getting into a certain company is tough, still walk into the interview with your head held up high, you know never know what great things you have in store;)

Devanshi Rastogi: Summer Intern at Microsoft India Insights on the Selection Process
In BCG, I was asked 2 case questions, one on profitability and another on market-entry. HUL process consisted of 2 rounds. First was a personal video interview on HireView platform where I had to record answers to 2-3 diverse time-bound questions, based on personality, supply chain and fluid mechanics. In the final interview round, they grill you on each point on your resume, testing you on the most miniscule details you’ve mentioned. Microsoft process had 3 rounds (for TPM profile)- One was a product case, wherein we had to submit our presentations on mail. Second and third round(in-person) were a mix of product cases (launch and improvement) and HR questions.

Devanshi Rastogi: Summer Intern at Microsoft India Preparation Resources
For consult-prep, I mainly referred the IITB and IIMA casebooks, however they are NOT to be read plainly. Practice them with your friends and specially seniors. 2. For TPM preparation, I personally didn’t find the need to do anything different since it coincided almost wholly with my consult prep. However, if you do not have any prior practice of solving consulting cases, then you should practice cases from product- management-based books and watch product interviews from YouTube.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Prepare a different resume for each target profile. Get them checked by as many seniors as possible (Y21s, Y20s and if possible Y19s also). Keep updating your resumes based on the advice you receive. CV submission is the most important step of this entire process, in my opinion. 2. Do NOT hesitate to contact seniors at all, they are the ones who’ll be able to help you throughout. 3. Be very thorough in each point of your CV and gain in-depth knowledge of the profile you’re preparing for. 4. Make sure you prepare well for HR questions; they are extremely important in deciding whether you’re a good fit for the role and company in general. 5. Be confident and crisp in your responses. Even when you’re not sure of an answer, politely tell the interviewer that you don’t know the answer. 6. One thing that helped me was that I took the learnings of one interview in the next. They maybe tips and insights that the interviewer observed about you or something you realized yourself. This will help you in improving your interview performance drastically.

Diptansu Poddar: Summer Intern at HUL Insights on the Selection Process
The first step of the application was a simple resume shortlisting. We could apply for either an RnD position or "Tech." Tech would land you in either R&D or supply chain, but the outcome would be determined by the final interview if chosen. You will also fill out an application form where they ask about your hobbies and passions. HUL puts great emphasis on CPI while shortlisting resumes. Cutoffs vary across branches and roles. For Chemical Engineers, Tech's cutoff was more than RnD's. HireVue Interview This is the second round. You must answer three questions and you get 2 minutes for each on the HireVue platform. The answers are automatically recorded and uploaded. The questions primarily involve strategy and supply chain problems; you cannot prepare much for them. You must use your intuition and presence of mind while justifying your answer.

There were two rounds, 1 technical and 1 HR round for Atlassian. In the technical round the coding questions were asked and I had to code the solution in some IDE and show the result, the interviewer was interactive and helpful and was giving me relevant hints when asked. In the HR round most of the questions were asked from my resume and projects. They wanted to test whether I had the values necessary for their company through my projects and IITK life.

The first step in the selection process was an online assessment. It comprised of 3 questions based on DSA. At least 2-2.5 questions were required to be solved for getting shortlisted. Also, a shortlist in the Uber She++ test helps a lot. This was followed by release of shortlist and interview.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Choose your priority order beforehand. I missed some important interviews. I thought I would get shortlisted in quadeye because my interview went very well and my CPI was good, but clearly that was not the case, that’s why I went to Uber’s interview (I had choices like Millenium and trexquant). Take actions considering the worst possible scenarios in mind. Also prepare for one level higher than what you are targeting, at least in my case my performance decreased significantly because of stress. I practiced a lot of hard questions that helped me survive Intern season day1. Get a good sleep. I remember I was unable the sleep the night before day1 )

Harshit Gupta: Summer Intern at JLR Insights on the Selection Process
Initially, there was a resume shortlisting, followed by a combined coding and aptitude test, and finally, one interview round. The test was relatively manageable, with coding questions of medium difficulty—around three, if memory serves correctly. I managed to solve two of them. Before the coding section, there was a timed aptitude segment, where we had to tackle as many questions as possible. The format involved an interesting twist Correct answers increased the difficulty of subsequent questions, while incorrect answers decreased it.

Harshit Gupta: Summer Intern at JLR Preparation Resources
I focused most of my preparation efforts during the summer. However, I had also completed a DSA course during the 4th semester and regularly practiced competitive programming, which helped improve my coding skills. I primarily used InterviewBit for resources and continued practicing competitive programming in May. Additionally, during this time, I worked on an ML project under Professor Avinash Sir from May to July and completed a one-month internship from mid-June to mid-July.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
I suggest identifying your own weaknesses and areas for improvement, rather than following what everyone else is doing. Only you can gauge your capacity effectively. Lastly, maintain consistency. Internship season can be stressful for everyone, so give it your best effort. Remember, it will all be over in 2-3 months.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
• There are 2 important things, CPI and coding skills. You can’t change your CPI. The only thing in your hand is coding. Don’t waste these 3 crucial months in summer. • Build your resume for at least 3 profiles. Get it verified by many many many seniors. I sent my resumes to > 20 seniors. • Do coding and puzzles, both daily (set your slots). • Give mock interviews. I gave it to some seniors as well as some organizations to help you in this. I had already applied off campus before main intern drive, so had an experience of interview in more than 10 corporates/ startups. This helped me so much that I was not at all nervous in any of my interviews on day 1. • Be confident in your interview. Think loud. Talk about whatever you are thinking. • Take your time, ask time if you want to think on some question. Don’t sit quite and start thinking. If you need time, ask for it, that won’t look bad then. • If you know the answer to a question, don’t say that you have solved the question earlier (obviously). • Ask questions at the end of the interview. Whenever I say this, people think about what to ask. Don’t ask dumb questions. Best is – ask your feedback. They will feel you are brave enough to ask. Interact with the interviewer. Ask about what he does in the company. Or ask what skills you need before joining next year – seems like you are interested in joining the company I think that’s all. If someone reading this wants to contact me, feel free to reach out anytime. I will be more that happy to share more gyaan xD. Good Luck!

Don’t get demotivated just because some companies rejected you, opportunities are plenty. Do not aim for a specific company early on – first make sure your overall intern prep is good. Learn about how to give good interviews. There are many minute details which distinguish a great interview from an average one. Make sure to give many mock interviews before Day 1.

The form was not to be written in the form of a resume however, and asked things in a very subjective manner, along with insights that you derived from your experiences. Video/GD Round For HUL, this was an online video submission round. There were 3 questions, which were problem solving based and answers were supposed to be focused on your approach to the problem and not the solution to the problem itself. For ITC, this was a GD. Interview Round For HUL, this was an online interview round, and had both core and HR questions. For ITC, there were 2 interviews. Both were resume-based and technical.

There are a total of 3 rounds Round 1 Resume cum Form round In this round, students are asked to fill out an online form known as the ‘ULIP Application Form’. Based on the resume and the form response, a branch-wise shortlist is made for each profile offered. Round 2 HireVue round HireVue is a hiring platform used to conduct video interviews. Unlike a normal interview, there is no live/actual interviewer on the other side in a HireVue video interview. In the HireVue video interview, there are a total of 3 questions. For each question, the question text is displayed for 2 minutes. In these 2 minutes, the candidate must analyze the question thoroughly and prepare an in-depth answer. After those 2 minutes, the candidate is asked to speak the prepared answer in 3 minutes. The candidate's answer is video recorded. Each profile (RnD, Supply Chain, Tech) has its own set of 3 questions. Each candidate in a given profile is asked the same set of questions. Based on the performance of the candidates, a profile-wise shortlist is made. Here, no branch considerations are made for a profile. Round 3 Final Interview The final interview is an interview with a senior manager at HUL. The interview may be conducted online or offline. In my case, it was conducted online. There is no HR round.

Cannot really prepare for Optiver, just have a calm head and please attempt the test well rested. There were two interview rounds, HR and Technical. The technical round is again composed of various Market making games. 2. Trexquant Was open to everyone with a CPI more than 8, was based on a take home test. The interview consisted of questions on the test and very simple (think 3-sum) leetcode problems. 3. Goldman Shortlisting based on some combination of Test and CPI. The interviews for the quant role consisted solely of Puzzles. I was asked stats theory but they were not fussy about it. Usually has 3-4 rounds of interview. 4. McKinsey Shortlisting based on CPI, PoRs. I am not really sure about it because I did not prepare for consulting roles.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Samsung R&D is the company that selected me, but you might be interested in hearing why I wasn't selected by other companies that interviewed me before this. My first interview was with Goldman Sachs. It was my first interview ever, so I was extremely nervous, and my preparation wasn't great—I struggled with coding and, more importantly, with probability and statistics. I want to emphasize that MSO201, which covers probability and statistics, is a crucial part of your preparation. The interviewer spent almost 30 minutes asking me about MSO concepts. So, if you're aiming for companies like Goldman Sachs, you must be confident in your coding skills, which only comes with thorough preparation, and you should have a solid understanding of MSO topics. This knowledge is also helpful for roles like quant analyst. The next interview was with Adobe, which was purely coding-based. Since I wasn't well- prepared for coding, I struggled and was rejected. The third interview was for a Qualcomm SDE role. During the interview, they mainly asked me about concepts from ESC201, EE200, and EE250. This was the best interview I ever had, but in the end, they only selected candidates from the CSE for the SDE role, as far as I recall. In conclusion, if you're confident in your skills, your interviews will likely go well. However, if you're underprepared, you'll find it challenging. My advice is to prepare thoroughly and stay calm during interviews. Good luck and prepare well!

Ruchit Rungta: Summer Intern at Amazon Insights on the Selection Process
For Amazon, there was one technical test and then one technical interview round. Technical Test Consisted of 2 sections- “Coding Assessment” and “Workstyle Assessment”. Coding Assessment 2 coding problems were asked. They required decent problem-solving and no particular algorithms or data structures (Kind of similar to Codeforces Div.2 A, B, C). Workstyle Assessment based on the Amazon Leadership Principles. Technical Interview There was only 1 interview round. I was asked for my introduction and then 2 coding problems were given. They were standard problems you would encounter when practicing InterviewBit, Leetcode etc. First was a problem on finding a target element in a sorted matrix. Second was based on finding the “boundary sum” in a Binary Tree. For Amazon, binary tree is one of the most frequently asked topics. Additional Advice Interviewers do not expect the most optimal solution from the very start. Also, do not assume the things that we usually assume or encounter when practicing. Ask clarifying questions wherever appropriate before/ while working on the problem. (e.g., clarify which elements should be considered to be boundary elements, unless specified) Ask for what to do if there’s an edge case (e.g., should I print -1 if target element doesn’t exist?). These skills are important as a Software Dev. Keep communicating what you’re thinking with the interviewer, they also help you with hints when you get stuck. One other thing you can work on for the interviews is the code quality. Make separate functions wherever applicable. Name the variables and functions appropriately (row, col instead of i, j when traversing 2D matrix etc.).

Ruchit Rungta: Summer Intern at Amazon Preparation Resources
Practicing and giving contests on Codeforces, Codechef or Atcoder is helpful for enhancing problem solving skills, especially for the technical test/ online assessment rounds. Videos of Striver on YouTube & his SDE sheet for preparing various topics and problems found on Leetcode, InterviewBit. Very helpful for technical interviews.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Consistency is key. Even when your schedule is busy, fix one 20-minute slot and focus on problem practice in that time. You can always extend the practice time, but working for just a few minutes will help you at least do non-zero practice every day! Spend some time preparing for HR interviews. Research common interview questions and practice your responses. Try speaking in front of a mirror or camera. You might struggle with problems or feel awkward when practicing interview responses at first, but remember, that's what practice is for. Some software companies ask for OOPs Concepts. Learn about Object Oriented Programming and prepare for interview questions based on it. Luck also plays a big role during the intern season. Do not spend time worrying about things beyond your control. Focus on what you can actually do right now. Don’t hesitate to contact your seniors for advice on your roles of interest.

Projects are very important as it makes you stand apart from others. I did projects in ML, Web Dev and Robotics. I also did internship in SURGE. Self projects are also good peaks for resume. Practicing techno-managerial questions before hand by giving mock interviews is a must to give the HR round confidently. As in Cisco’s process many candidates cleared the first 2 rounds but were rejected in HR round. Giving mock interview on interview-bit and other websites or even to your seniors who have cleared the interviews will be helpful. CS fundamentals are also important and can be asked in interviews, so remember to cover them too.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
If you think that your resume is likely to get shortlisted, you can start practicing cases even before the shortlist is out. (Don’t wait for them to start the resume submission process; in our case, the process started pretty late, which gave very little time for people to practice. Even if the shortlist is not out, start practicing in the 1st week of July.). Try to make a small case group (mine had 3 people) and practice daily with them. (We practiced 1 case per person every day.). You can start with guesstimates, then practice profitability, then unconventional cases and then market entry cases. It is recommended to practice at least 10–15 cases in each of these categories. You can possibly have a look at pricing, growth, and mergers as well. Ensure that you have practiced your introduction multiple times. Try to mention things you wish to talk about in your introduction. (like your coolest internship, your POR, or your extracurricular activity)

There were three rounds in total- 1.Technical Test – They asked a fundamental question and tougher questions from topics like DP and graphs. The deciding factor was their platform usage, since you had to solve it on their platform without any Autocomplete and had very different patterns of taking in the input. 2.Round 1 – There was only one question asked to me from Heaps, and the requirement was to code it and run it on your system to show the correct output. Its difficulty was almost Leetcode Hard. 3.Round 2(Final) – This was the round where you had to show your temperament while thinking about things, which, in my opinion, was an excellent approach to an interview. The interviewer wanted to know how the person thinks and what their way of optimizing things is. He made me go through one question, which was just a discussion on how to solve it, starting from brute force and discussing it up to the level that it gets very optimized after 4-5 approaches that we discussed. Then came a lot of basic aptitude-based coding questions that tested out-of- the-box thinking skills.

Solve a lot of Leetcode and Interviewbit questions and understand them rather than learn them, and really understand all the questions that you attempt during the phase of technical tests, that makes you grow a lot. I think asking a good question to the interviewer at the end can make a good impression as well, but not always necessary.

There were 3 rounds , 2 technical and one HR. In first half the interviewer mainly asked about projects on resume and asked me to explain the project on federated learning. After this discussion he told me to write a code to build a binary tree and find its height which was pretty easy , after that he modified few parts of code and asked me to identify why the code gave segmentation faults and asked why does segmentation fault occur. After this he asked about object oriented programming.I explained all the concepts , after which he asked me to code an example for polymorphism in whichever language I was comfortable with. 2nd round was also a technical round where he first he asked about data types. Then gave a simple question to create a Linked list and swap nodes 3rd round was the HR round where the HR asked about one course project (CS220) and discussed about some non-technical situations.

Shishir: Summer Intern at American Express Insights on the Selection Process
I was selected through a series of coding test followed by shortlisting and 2 rounds of interview. Coding round- There were questions from DSA, and development problems to be solved in R and javascript. Insights regarding selection- familiarity with coding rounds since I have been eligible for most the companies in the round one inter drive. Practicing problem solving under time constraint and doing projects where I explored other domains really came in to rescue. Hence coding round was cleared. Regarding interview- Round 1- It was basically a technical interview which started with basic introduction and project & skill discussion followed by a doable DSA question. Round-2 was hard where tricky questions were asked and resume was thoroughly discussed. insights on interview- Know how to lead an interview. It is not just a Q&A round where you are supposed to simply answer what is asked. The skills, knowledge, and even personality is judged. Therefore , you must know your resume , the strength and weakness and lead the interview accordingly. Practice mock interviews.

There was resume shortlisting and a screening test (included, aptitude and personality test questions). Following the shortlist, senior and junior buddies were assigned, with whom I did the buddy rounds (case studies), and then there was a dinner in Gurugram. Finally, interviews were scheduled on the Day-1 of internship drive.

Shivansh Gupta: Summer Intern at Bain & company Preparation Resources
For Consulting, I prepared by learning from the video playlist by Aaditya Agarwal on YouTube, and some random YouTube videos on few key concepts. Some CIC videos could also be seen, to understand the process of how case studies are to be solved in an interview setting. Practiced with peers from CIC, IIMA and SRCC Casebooks. Did cases with seniors. Apart from Consulting profile, did coding practice on Interview Bit, and learned from YouTube playlists. Aptitude and Puzzles were done from 50 challenging Problems in Prob and Stats, Heard on the Street, Puzzled Quant and BrainStellar. Selected chapters from XinFeng Zhou’s Quantitative Finance book could also be done for finance and probability.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Don’t rely on 1 profile only, diversify and prepare for 2-3 roles whole heartedly. (Ensure that you don’t end up preparing for all too). Selection of roles is difficult, but elimination is easier. - Don’t see consulting as an alternative to coding. Preparation for consulting is to be done from around shortlist time only, do coding and other prep before that. - Don’t skip the interview tests of other companies, even if you think you’re gonna make it in one. - Relax, internships are just a phase, and not an end of the world, so don’t forget to enjoy your summers too. Good friend circle is really helpful to survive the lonely, scorching summers on campus (or at home), nd BT mt lo zyada ;-)

Shwetank Anand: Summer Intern at Amazon Insights on the Selection Process
From SDE point of view, there was only one coding round when it comes to Amazon where two standard DSA questions (min heap and mathematical manipulation) were asked. It ranged from code writing with explanation, optimization and briefing of the solutions in detail. The most important thing is that standard questions and implementation must be on tips especially for topics like trees, graphs, data structures like maps, heaps, queues and stacks. What is quintessential is to ace the interview questions they ask and put in best efforts to solve it diligently. One must be decent in C++ and with the STL implementation.

Shwetank Anand: Summer Intern at Amazon Preparation Resources
Some of the resources that you used during your preparation? SDE P-club Archives are the most important one as it gives you an actual idea about how the questions are going to be. Any standard SDE sheet that covers all the topics and basic questions like Striver’s. Practice thoroughly either on the interviewbit ladder or Leetcode (p.s. try doing 2 easy 3 medium 1 hard from all the topics). After this, one can refer to CSES problemset for completion and revision. Contests on standard platforms like CF, CC, Atcoder maybe helpful and is completely optional. Might help in time and accuracy. Core/FMCG Be thorough with the courses that you have done. Especially for ME, CHE, AE, topics like Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Elementary Solid Mechanics might be a good point to start over. GDs form a chunk of the selection process. Take advise from seniors and form a group targeting for the role to have mock GD sessions under senior’s guidance. Case studies of Group Discussions maybe found on the internet. (e.g. Should a particular worker be fired or not among a diverse group of workers?) Try reading through several such articles and practice few GDs in person to familiarize yourself. Miscellaneous To broaden the spectrum, it is recommended to go through an adequate number of puzzles on sites like GFG, brainstellar and puzzledquant. It comes to help in interview rounds of analyst roles, quant-based firms and several others as well. If time permits, it mightbe a good idea to skim over MSO201 (Probability and Statistics) notes, some acquaintance with concepts like OOPS, DBMS, OS (might refer small playlists available on youtube) that mightbe helpful in subsequent interviews.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Do not compare yourself with others. Keep working hard along the line whatever you have decided. Try to be collaborative and keep a learning attitude with your peers. 2. Do not try to do a lot many things simultaneously. Segregate few specific roles and work in that direction. Reach out to seniors who are in those roles and communicate. 3. Be confident in your interviews. No interviewer expects you to be perfect. Making mistakes or not knowing something in the interview is absolutely okay, you just need to keep your calm through the rest of it. 4. Be prepared completely about each and every word that is mentioned in your resume. Failure to comply comes out as a negative impression and avoid any such thing. 5. Keep yourself composed mentally throughout the entire process. It is like a journey where be for the people, take help from parents, friends and everyone. Try to work sincerely five to six hours on a daily basis and substantial changes would be evident.

Talk to seniors who have been selected in your company of interest. They can give you first hand experiences of their interviews and kind of questions asked Listen to the company’s PPT intently. It might help you in the HR questions asked in your interviews Once interview fixed, try to collect maximum info about the company’s business model, products, financial numbers etc Be familiar with general HR questions Articulate your thoughts well and think out aloud while solving puzzles and guesstimates. Know current basic numerals of Indian economy to answer guesstimates. Some more important points  Make a good resume with as much relevant projects as possible. Unlike consulting resumes, extracurriculars and PORs need not be very elaborate. Get your resume verified by as much seniors as possible. You might get mixed opinions, finally stick to what you find the best. You can target a specific company while making a specific domain resume. For analytics including projects which involve ML concepts is a big plus. Knowing SQL is a sweet spot. It is alright if you know just the basics. It is really easy and watching any Youtube video will give you a fair working idea. Have fair understanding of ML concepts to answer technical questions.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Make sure that you are prepared to answer questions in front of the interview, and not just solving them yourself. Questions were asked about my resume and I would suggest that you prepare to explain the points that you write. Make sure to be vocal about the problem solving process so that the interviewer can guide you if you go wrong somewhere. Being too silent in the interview will be a detriment. Get enough sleep before the interviews, as they can be very tiring. You must be consistent throughout your interview preparations, and give adequate time to DSA and CP as they cannot

The second round of interview concentrated on questions related to ML and mathematical modeling of problems. There was also a HR round, but it only involved a basic background check.

vrinda sharma: Summer Intern at Boston Consulting Group Insights on the Selection Process
Resume Shortlist Resume is shortlisted on the basis of 'peaks' in a resume that can testify your excellence in extracurricular activities. CPI is used as a general indicator for academic excellence. However, for several branches with bad grading, make sure you are in the top 1-2 percentile of your branch. Further classification of peaks is as follows 1. CPI & Academic Scholarships (NTSE, KVPY, Reliance, Other Govt. Scholarships etc.) 2. Research Experience A good project with any professor (IIT, IIM, IISc etc.). It is even better if such a project is pursued under a summer program like Surge, Spark, etc. 3. Any impactful work done in college is generally reflected through your PoR. 4. Any industry exposure you have had generally reflected through remote internships in the field of your choice. 5. Inter IIT Medals, Social Work, and any other miscellaneous activity that you feel can make you stand out. (On how to choose this miscellaneous activity think of a key quality it reflects about you and how desirable that quality is, egs a youtube channel, an art account, a degree in performing arts, etc.)

vrinda sharma: Summer Intern at Boston Consulting Group Preparation Resources
Victor Cheng videos. Watched 2-3 CIC videos. And did 4-5 cases from IIM-A casebook. (because that's the only way you can practice with your peers, initially) However, my advice would be to jump right into live cases with immediate seniors. That would speed up your learning curve. And then move onto doing cases with more senior batches, Post this exposure you can practice cases with your peers, However, stress upon practicing cases that your peers have done with other seniors rather than following a particular book. The former cases are done much more naturally and hence, prove to be more useful. Make sure you do 2-3 cases with your buddy. They may be done at a gap of 1 week.

Advice for students (dos and don’ts)?
Stay confident, A confident person can turn even a single shortlist in their favor & an under confident one can ruin any number of chances given to them, 2. Keep with yourself a mentor to help you throughout this journey. During the internship season, peers are also in tough situations and hence you might be at a loss of people to confide in. 3. Keep coding. You mayn't be interested however, if you do it everyday thinking this is a 'backup', you will never be good enough at it. 4. If you undertake internship preparation nicely, you will see a paradigm shift in yourself. Hence, do it to meet the better version of yourself on the other side, and not for any MNC. All the best )
